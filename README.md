Random Compression

Algorithm RC:

Find three matches 3 that every on of this 0000-1111 matches change to two next three block 1024 bits Do this (2**40)-1 times or less.

2048 bits -1 bit or +1

We try to predict varition of 4 bits about (2**40)-1 or less times if we predict this varition and files we times of compress file +1 that we will save it we start from 0 and go to 15 and repeat this again and again about times on the top. When we predict and compress we save this four bits. If compress we write 0 else if file on the end compresss 0 else 1 on the end we add 1 and left bits.
