Random Compression

Algorithm RC:

Random generate file possible to compress but not any file.
My algorithm can compress random generate files 1MB per few hours or more seconds to few KB. My algorithn compression has limit of size could compress not any file if size of the 671B-20KB or more it can compress random generate files.

Random Compression
Algorithm RC:
Find three matches 3 that every on of this 0000-1111 matches change to two next three, block 1024 bits Do this size of //16 times or less.
2048 bits -1 bit or +1 if bigger few bytes or less.
We try to predict variations of 4 bits. If we predict this variations and files we times of compress file +1 that we will save it we start from 0 and go to 15 and repeat this again and again about times on the top. When we predict and compress. If compress we write 0 else if file on the end compress 0 else 1 on the end we add 1 and left bits. Can exist 000-111 third matches before the number that front. If this 6 bits already exist or -1 then Find=0 or not equal 6 two blocks then this two blocks not compress we count as one 2048 blocks big -1 or +1 bit.
Compress every time and Paq9a.
