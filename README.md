Algorithm RC: Random Compression Algorithm RC:  Find 0000-1111 if string find string 0 save as 01, Move information like queue string char move bits of block back -1 and front -1, If e.: 000001001111-111100000100, if find 01, if find 01XX-10XX, save where times save. 0 if end if file times compress else 1 and where it that on top. This algorithm can compress Random generated files. Blocks long need increase every time. Times and times of times. Add 1 on the start and 0-7 zeros.
